### Cleanup
Runs cleanup by name of image.\
`housekeeper cleanup gitlab_dev_16.2.2`

Performs idempotent cleanup of existing images by name. Keeps the latest image based on the git commit sha in the image tags. If unable to retrieve the latest N commits, it retains the last built image. Images with the 'public' attribute remain unaffected. Supports setting values through environment variables.

```

```
### Publish
Publishes an image by its UUID.
All images with the same name are first set to the following state: `visibility: private`, `protected: false`, `hidden: false`.\
Then, the image being published is set to the `visibility: public` state, with the `protected` and `hidden` values determined by the respective `--protected` and `--hidden` flags, defaulting to `false`.\
Supports setting values through environment variables.
